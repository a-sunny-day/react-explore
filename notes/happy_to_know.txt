In the client side of the application sha1 algorithm to hash the sensitive information. However it remains vulnerable, as it is considered completely unsafe


In this case, user passwords are hashed using the md5 function from the CryptoJS module before being sent to the backend for storing them in the database (/src/containers/forms/RegisterForm.js).

n case the user is inactive for 15 minutes, the Idle component cleans up the session. Also, the lifetime of the session is set to 120 minutes (maxAge), 
which is reset on every response (rolling is set to true), which means if a user closes the browser, the cookie will expire after 120 minutes.
